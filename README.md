# 👋 Hi, I'm Soumi — Full-Stack Developer

👩‍💻 I build **scalable web applications** and **AI-integrated solutions** that solve real-world problems.  
💡 Passionate about problem-solving, clean code, and creating intuitive user experiences.  
🌱 Continuously learning new tools, frameworks, and best practices to deliver real-world projects.

I specialize in both **frontend and backend development**, from designing responsive UI in React to building RESTful APIs with Node.js/Django, and deploying projects to the cloud. My goal is to **turn ideas into fully functional products** that users love.
